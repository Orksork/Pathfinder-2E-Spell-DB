A creature can take this damage only once per turn, even if it moves through several hazards. Choose bludgeoning, slashing, piercing, acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage when you cast ephemeral hazards; resistances and weaknesses to those damage types apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. You can freely choose the appearance and damage type of each hazard as long as its appearance reflects the type of damage it deals (for instance, a hazard that deals piercing damage might take the form of sharpened spikes).  \r\n**Critical Success**  The creature is unaffected by the hazards and no longer needs to attempt Will saves against them.  \r\n**Success**  The creature realizes the hazards aren’t real but still takes half damage from them; on future Will saves against the hazards, the creature continues to use this result unless it rolls a critical success.  \r\n**Failure**  The target takes full damage and treats the square as difficult terrain.  \r\n**Critical Failure**  The target takes double damage and cannot pass through a square containing a hazard.  \r\n**Heightened (+1)**  The damage increases by 1d6.",

The spell gains the air trait if you choose air or mist, and the water trait if you choose water or mist. You become amorphous, as does your armor. You lose any item bonus to AC and use your proficiency bonus for unarmored defense to determine your AC. You also gain resistance 10 to physical damage and become immune to precision damage. You can slip through tiny cracks and don't need to breathe. You can't cast spells, activate items, or use actions that have the attack or manipulate trait, except those granted by this spell. You also gain the following effects based on your form.Air You gain a fly Speed of 20 feet and become invisible while you are in the air. You can create the effects of a gust of wind from your space as a 2-action activity, which has the manipulate trait.\nMist You gain a fly Speed of 20 feet, and it becomes hard to see through you. Any creature on one side of your space who is targeted by a creature on the opposite side is concealed to the targeting creature.Water You gain a swim Speed of 20 feet and become invisible while you are in the water. You can electrically charge yourself by taking a single action, which has the manipulate trait. If you do, you are no longer invisible in the water due to electricity indicating your location, but any creature that makes a melee attack against you takes 1d6 electricity damage; if it touches you, this is cumulative with the damage from your major curse.  \r\n**Heightened (+2)**  Increase the resistance by 5 and the electricity damage from the charged water form by 1.",

The spell similarly suppresses magical light of the spell's level or lower. Light can't pass through, so creatures in the area can't see outside. Even creatures with darkvision (but not greater darkvision) can barely see through the darkness; any creatures seen through the darkness are concealed to them. Creatures with greater darkvision can see through the darkness normally. Creatures who move into the field or start their turn within the field have some of the life and light sucked out of them, taking 2d6 bludgeoning damage and 2d6 negative damage, with a basic Fortitude save. When you cast this spell, choose up to four allies in the area to spare from darklight's effects. Until the spell ends, they're immune to damage from darklight spells and can see through darklight (but not other darkness) as though they had greater darkvision.  \r\n**Heightened (10th)**  The bludgeoning and negative damage both increase to 3d6.",

(A standard adventuring rope has Hardness 2, HP 8, and a Broken Threshold of 4.)Coil The rope forms a tidy, coiled stack.Crawl The rope inches along the ground like a snake, moving one of its ends 10 feet. The rope must move along a surface, but that surface doesn't need to be horizontal.Knot The rope ties a sturdy knot in itself.Loop The rope forms a simple loop at one or both ends, or straightens itself back out.Tie The rope ties itself around a willing creature or an object that's unattended or attended by a willing creature.Undo The rope undoes one of its knots, ties, or bindings.  \r\n**Heightened (+2)**  The range increases by 50 feet, and you can animate 50 more feet of rope.",

You can also make one attempt to Steal as part of Casting umbral extraction.

When you Cast the Spell and each time you Sustain the Spell, you can roll the orb, moving it up to 10 feet along the ground or the surface of a liquid. You can gain this effect multiple times in the same round by Sustaining the Spell multiple times. The orb can move through the spaces of any creatures or obstacles that wouldn't stop the flow of water. It extinguishes non-magical fires it moves through of its size or smaller, and it attempts to counteract any magical fires it moves through. If it fails to counteract a given fire, it can't counteract that fire for the duration of the spell. The orb can also collect creatures it moves through. Any Large or smaller creature whose space the orb tries to move through can attempt a Reflex save against your spell DC to avoid being engulfed. If a creature succeeds at this save, it can either let the orb pass (remaining in its space or moving out of the orb's path into a space of the creature's choice) or allow itself to be pushed in front of the orb to the end of the orb's movement. The orb can try to Engulf the same creature only once per turn, even if you roll it onto a creature's space more than once. A creature that fails its save is pulled into the orb. It becomes grabbed, moves along with the orb, and must hold its breath or begin suffocating (unless it can breathe in water). An engulfed Medium or smaller creature and anyone trying to affect that creature follow the normal rules for aquatic battles. An engulfed Large creature is usually big enough that parts of it stick out from the water, and it can reach out of the water. An engulfed creature can get free either by Swimming with a successful DC 10 Athletics check or by Escaping against your spell DC. A creature that critically failed its Reflex save is further stuck and must attempt to Escape instead of Swim. A freed creature exits the orb's space and can immediately breathe. The orb can contain as many creatures as can fit in its space. When the spell ends, all creatures the orb has engulfed are automatically released.",

This extradimensional storage doesn't hamper the target's ability to eat, drink, speak (if applicable), or otherwise act, as it only opens and closes when the target chooses. The target can Interact to swallow an object of up to 1 Bulk, which doesn't harm the object or the target. If the extradimensional space is full, the target can't add any more objects until first removing one or more stored objects. Organic matter and living creatures can't be stored in this space. The extradimensional storage is obvious to any creature who looks into the target's mouth, as the entryway shimmers slightly, though this doesn't clearly reveal the contents inside. The target can Interact to spit out a single object of its choice, causing the object to fall to the ground in the target's space. The target can Interact three times in a row to spit out the entire contents of its extradimensional storage; the target doesn't have to take these actions all in the same turn, but if it takes any other actions in between, it has to start over. The items eject into the target's space, possibly spilling out into adjacent spaces if there is too much to fit. When the spell ends or the target falls unconscious, the contents of the extradimensional storage are disgorged in a riotous spew, landing in the nearest unoccupied space, a bit wet but otherwise unharmed.  \r\n**Heightened (5th)**  The duration increases to 8 hours.",

The duplicate appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of you and repeats a basic single action the target took since the end of your last turn, such as making a Strike or Interacting to pull a lever. Because the other basic single actions don't produce much of a result on their own, this is typically used for Strike and Interact, though occasionally it could be useful to have a temporal twin Stride through a potentially dangerous area to expose a hazard. The target ally spends a reaction to create the duplicate, makes any decisions, and rolls for the repeated action, such as choosing a target for a Strike and making the attack roll. If the ally doesn't have a reaction to spend, temporal twin fails. Use the duplicate's location for determining flanking, cover, and the like. Using this spell requires remembering what your ally did, and if you don't remember the details, the GM might not allow you to cast temporal twin. This action can't be used for anything but a basic single action, nor can it use limited resources. The action can have a different target than the original action but must be very similar in form. For example, if the original action were to Interact to pull a lever, the time duplicate could pull a different lever, but couldn't turn a doorknob or pick up an item from a table. Being pulled through time to create a twin destabilizes the target's timeline. Once an ally has been the target of temporal twin, they're temporarily immune for 1 day.",

Each sensor looks where that target looks, and all the targets can link their vision briefly to help notice things one target sees but the others might not. Each target can use an action, which has the concentrate trait, to share what it sees with any number of other targets until the start of its next turn. Only one creature can share its vision at a time, so if another target takes this action, the effect ends for any target that was previously sharing its vision. This improves how well the recipients can perceive anything the sharing creature is looking at. For instance, if a creature is undetected to a recipient but observed by the sharing creature, the creature becomes observed by the recipient as well. Typically, the creature is seen as a glowing outline superimposed on its position. This might allow the recipient to target a creature it couldn't otherwise; however, cover and line of effect still might prevent or impede targeting and attacks. This can only improve the recipient's vision, not reduce it; for example, if an enemy was undetected by the sharing creature and observed by a recipient, the recipient would still clearly observe the enemy. Once the vision sharing stops, the benefit ends. Whether a creature is hidden or undetected is still based on the last information a target had before the vision sharing ended. For example, that means if a creature is behind a wall but hasn't moved, it's still hidden rather than undetected by a recipient that witnessed its current position.",

That spell ceases  to affect the target, and you can either cause the spell to affect you or store it in your shadow. If your attempt to Steal was a critical success, you automatically steal the spell if its level is equal to or lower than umbral graft. If it was a success, you automatically steal it if its level is lower than umbral graft. If you succeeded, but the spell's level was too high to steal automatically, you must attempt a counteract check to see if you steal the spell. You know what the spell is as soon as you steal it. If you store it, you can transfer it to a willing creature as a single action that has the manipulate trait. The spell lasts for its remaining duration, to a maximum of 1 minute, and any time you keep it stored subtracts from its duration normally. The spell gains the shadow trait. You can't steal constant innate spells that are always active on a creature, such as a choral angel's constant tongues, or innate spells that have special restrictions that remove their ability to target other creatures, such as an imp's invisibility. At the GM's discretion, you might not be able to steal innate spells with other unusual modifications to the base spell. As normal, you can Steal only from a target within your reach. Once you've stolen a spell, you can't attempt to Steal more spells, nor can you choose not to take a spell if you succeed at your Thievery check. When you cast umbral graft, any spells you stole with a previous umbral graft end even if their duration hasn't elapsed. If you're affected by both umbral graft and umbral extraction, you make the choice whether to steal a spell slot, an active spell, or an item each time you Steal.",

        "description": "A Medium floating, disembodied hand made of magical force appears in an unoccupied space adjacent to you, following you across the battlefield to shield you against your foes' attacks. Each time you Sustain the Spell, the hand moves to an unoccupied space of your choice adjacent to you. When you Sustain the Spell, you can have the hand Fly to an unoccupied space of your choice adjacent to an ally to protect that ally instead. The hand's movement does not trigger reactions based on creature movement. Successful attacks against the hand damage it, and damaging effects that can target a creature can target the hand. The hand has an AC of 25, 50 Hit Points, and can't recover HP by any means. A hit by a disintegrate spell or similar effect destroys the hand. The hand's actions and the cover it provides depend on what actions you take during your turn. At the end of your turn, what the hand does is determined by the first entry on this list that matches a trait from any of the actions you used on your turn. For instance, if you Step, Stride, and Sustain the Spell, you use the entry for move actions, so the hand provides standard cover. Manipulate or Attack The hand interposes between you and your foes. It provides lesser cover (+1 circumstance bonus to AC) against all attacks that pass through the hand's square.Move The hand provides standard cover (+2 circumstance bonus to AC, Reflex, and Stealth checks) against all attacks that pass through the hand's square.Concentrate The hand provides greater cover (+4 circumstance bonus to AC, Reflex, and Stealth checks) against all attacks that pass through the hand's square.  \r\n**Heightened (6th)**  The hand has AC 27 and 60 Hit Points. When you Cast this Spell, you can choose to replace the hand's Manipulate or Attack option with Swat. Swat The hand Flies to an enemy of your choice within range and attempts to Push that enemy, using your spell attack roll instead of an Athletics check to determine the results of the Push.\n  \r\n**Heightened (7th)**  The hand has AC 30 and 70 Hit Points, and it is Large. When you Cast this Spell, you can choose to replace the hand's Manipulate or Attack option with Grasp or Swat. Grasp The hand Flies to an enemy of your choice within range and attempts to Grapple that enemy, using your spell attack roll instead of an Athletics check to determine the results of the Grapple.\n  \r\n**Heightened (8th)**  The hand has AC 32 and 80 Hit Points, and it is Large. When you Cast this Spell, you can choose to replace the hand's Manipulate or Attack option with Grasp, Punch, or Swat. Punch The hand Flies to an enemy of your choice within range and attempts to Strike that enemy with crushing force. The hand's Strikes use your melee spell attack modifiers and deal 7d8 force damage. The hand's Strikes don't use or contribute to your multiple attack penalty.  \r\n**Heightened (9th)**  The hand has AC 35 and 90 Hit Points, and it is Large. When you Cast this Spell, you can choose to replace the hand's Manipulate or Attack option with Crush, Grasp, Punch, or Swat. Crush If the hand doesn't have a target grabbed, it Flies to an enemy of your choice within range and attempts to Strike that enemy with deadly crushing force. The hand's Strikes are melee spell attacks that deal 6d8 force damage. The hand's Strikes don't take or contribute to your multiple attack penalty. On a successful Strike, the target is grabbed by the hand until the end of your next turn, unless the hand moves or the target successfully Escapes against your spell DC. However, if the hand has a target grabbed when it uses Crush, it instead Constricts the target, dealing 6d8 force damage with a basic Fortitude save.",

The total height of the pillars is 30 feet, which must be used in 10-foot increments (for example, you could create three 10-foot-tall pillars, one 20-foot-tall pillar and one 10-foot-tall pillar, or one 30-foot-tall pillar). Each pillar is 5 feet by 5 feet in length and width. The pillars must be conjured on a relatively flat area of natural earthen terrain such as sand, dirt, stone, or clay. Regardless of the terrain, the pillars are always made of tightly compacted sand particles that together become as hard and solid as stone (DC 15 Athletics to Climb). If a creature occupies the space where you cast this spell, it is carried upward atop the pillar. The creature can attempt a Reflex save (DC equal to the caster's spell DC); on a success, the creature can either attempt to Grab an Edge or move into an adjacent unoccupied square. If the pillar would rise higher than the ceiling, it firmly abuts the ceiling but does not rise any higher. A creature caught between a pillar and a ceiling takes no damage (subject to GM discretion, such as is in the case of stalactites or other hazards) but becomes immobilized. The creature can attempt an Escape check to free itself, but it must thereafter Grab an Edge, Climb down, or fall from the top of the pillar. The Grab an Edge and Escape DCs are the same as the Reflex save. As part of your action to Sustain the Spell, you can choose to either destroy one of your pillars, causing it to immediately crumble into nothing, or create a new pillar, as long as doing so wouldn't exceed the total number of feet of pillar you can create. You can Sustain the Spell two or more times on a single turn to destroy or create a pillar.  \r\n**Heightened (+1)**  The total height of the pillars increases by 10 feet, but must still be used in 10-foot increments (this also increases the total number of pillars that can be created by one).",

Casting return beacon while a beacon is active causes the previous return beacon spell to end. If you are not within 1 mile of the beacon, your attempt to transport yourself to the beacon fails.

Both checks require the creature attempting them to have expert proficiency in order to succeed. You can Dismiss temporal ward. The maximum number of temporal wards you can have active at a time is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.\n  \r\n**Critical Success**  The creature is unaffected and opens the doorway or the container as normal.  \r\n**Success**  The creature experiences a brief moment of dé jà-vu in which they're convinced they already opened the door. They must use an additional action to open the door. If they can't or don't want to do so, the action or activity they used to open the door or container is wasted, and the door or container remains closed.  \r\n**Failure**  The creature is thrown briefly backwards in time. The action or activity they used to open the door or container is wasted and they're returned to the position they were located at during the start of their turn. Their turn then ends.  \r\n**Critical Failure**  As failure, but the temporal displacement also causes the creature to lose their bearings, making them confused for 1 minute.  \r\n**Heightened (10th)**  The temporal ward has an unlimited duration, until it is counteracted, Dismissed, or Disarmed.",

When you Cast the Spell, the ally you targeted (or you, if you targeted yourself) may teleport to any unoccupied space of their choice within 30 feet of its fated opponent. This is a teleportation effect. You isolate the two targets for 1 round. During this time, fate refuses to allow either fated opponent to be affected by attacks or effects from a third party; a fated opponent could be affected by the other's meteor swarm or its own heal spell, but it would be entirely immune to a spell or Strike from a creature outside of the spells effects, as well including damage from a hazard or the environment. This doesn't apply to anything that was affecting the targets before you cast fated confrontation (such as a spell with a duration or persistent damage the creature had before it was affected by fated confrontation). For the duration of the spell, either fated opponent can manipulate fate once on each of its turns. This allows it to either roll twice and take the higher result on an attack roll or skill check it makes against its fated opponent (a fortune effect), or force the fated opponent to roll twice on a saving throw against one of its abilities and take the lower result (a misfortune effect). This spell ends if either target becomes unable to act, or if they both agree to cease hostilities.",

For example, if you deity is lawful good, you can't summon a chaotic or evil creature. The GM might determine that deities restrict specific types of creatures even if their alignments aren't diametrically opposed. For example, Pharasma would restrict the summoning of sahkils.

For an attended item, this persistent damage occurs at the end of the attending creature's turns; if the item was unattended when you Cast the Spell, the damage happens at the end of your turns.

Each of the four quadrants of the fort is guarded by a tyrannosaurus. While the tyrannosauruses won't cross into the others' territories, their reach allows them to simultaneously attack an intruder near the center of the fort. The tyrannosauruses leave you and anyone you introduce to them alone but treat anyone else they find in the fort as intruders and prospective snacks. When you prepare spells, you can choose not to recover the spell slot you used to cast this spell. If you do, the fort remains for another 24 hours. The fort must be created on a plot of land free of other structures. It adapts to the natural terrain, adopting the structural requirements for being built there. The fort adjusts around small features, such as ponds or spires of rock, but can't be created on water or other nonsolid surfaces. If created on snow, sand dunes, or other soft surfaces with a solid surface underneath, the foundation reaches solid ground. If created on a solid but unstable surface, such as a swamp or an area plagued by tremors, roll a DC 3 flat check each day the fort is present; on a failure, the fort sinks or collapses sometime during that day, and the spell ends. The fort doesn't harm creatures within the area when it appears, and it can't be created within a crowd or in a densely populated area. Any creature inadvertently caught inside the fort when the spell is cast ends up unharmed inside the complete fort and always has a clear path of escape.",
